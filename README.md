## What is FreakC ?
FreakC is a transpiled multi-paradigm esoteric scripting language that... has nothing to do with the C programming language. This language's syntax is dirty and funny (or even offensive), but technically, it functions just like a normal language and is able to create usable programs. It is very similar to Batch, and it is also transpiled to Batch.

## Why FreakC ?
If you are drunk or freaking crazy, FreakC is like Gordon Ramsay's Beef Wellington to homeless people. (Yes)

But to take it seriously, even though it's an esolang, it provides:

* Multi-paradigm (procedural, functional, even OOP).
* Many prebuilt standard libraries to make scripting easier.
* A full-blown cli.
* Compatibility with Batch (You can embed Batch codes in FreakC).

### Language preview
Hello World:

    Swear[fnc] Hello, World!

Function definition

    ProduceTrash[fnc] SayHello
        Swear[fnc] Hello
    EndTrash[fnc]
    :: Prints "Hello"
    GrabFnc[fnc] SayHello
    
To check out more samples, click <a href=https://github.com/FreakC-Foundation/FreakC/tree/master/Examples>here.</a>

## What comes with the devkit ?
* A compiler.
* An interactive shell.
* A full-blown cli.
* Some utilities.
* Some examples.

**Yet, this is an esolang.**

## Compiler's usage
In the "FreakC" folder, open cmd and type this command to compile and run the code:

    freakc file_name
    
Example:
    
    freakc "Examples/HelloWorld.fclang"
 
If you want to compile the code only, type:

    freakc file_name --compile
    
If you want to compile the code and show the compiled code, type:

    freakc file_name --candr
    
To show the current version of the devkit, type:

    freakc --version

To create a new FreakC project quickly, you can type:

    freakc project_name --create

Notice that it will generate a file with a Hello World example in it, if you just want to create an empty file, type:

    freakc project_name --create --empty 
    
To show all options and usage, type:

    freakc --help
    
To show all options and usage (with a dumb ascii art), type:

    freakc
    
### Interactive shell
To open interactive shell, type:

    freakc --shell
    ::Or fcshell
    
You can type in whatever you want, it will be stored in "tar.fclang". You can type in any of these commands to execute tasks:

* `StartFuckin[cli]` - Runs all the codes written
* `StopFuckin[cli]` - Delete tar.fclang and exit
* `WipeAss[cli]` - Resets codes
* `Shit[cli]` - Clear console


**The compiler only works on Windows, and can only be compiled to Batch.**

## In what part does FreakC upgrade from Batch ?
If you are asking yourself, "what does FreakC have that Batch don't have", then here they are (though it's an esolang):
* Libraries like "float", "arrayfunc".
* While loops and other additional commands.
* Modules and stuffs.

## Convert FreakC to .EXE files
In "FreakC/Utilities/Scripts" there is a file called battoexe.bat which helps to convert .bat files to .exe files.

So to convert FreakC to .EXE files, you need to compile FreakC codes to Batch, and then convert the Batch file generated by simply dragging that Batch file onto battoexe.bat.

You can actually find plenty of other tools online that helps you to converts Batch files to EXE files.

## Frameworks
Note that all Batch frameworks can integrate well with FreakC, so you can use them just like in Batch smoothly. There are some in the **Utilities** folder (which I don't own).

### Game frameworks
There are many existing game engines for Batch/FreakC:
