## What is FreakC ?
FreakC is a transpiled esoteric scripting language that... has nothing to do with the C programming language. This language's syntax is dirty and funny (or even offensive), but it can actually make many decent programs. It is very similar to Batch, and it is also transpiled to Batch.

## Why FreakC ?
If you are drunk or freaking crazy, FreakC is like Gordon Ramsay's Beef Wellington to homeless people. (Yes)

## What is in the devkit ?
<li>A FreakC compiler</li>
<li>Some optional utilities</li>

## Compiler's usage
In the "FreakC" folder, open cmd and type this command to compile and run the code:

    freakc file_name
    
Example:
    
    freakc "Examples/HelloWorld.fclang"
 
If you want to compile the code only, type:

    freakc file_name --compile
    
If you want to compile the code and show the compiled code, type:

    freakc file_name --candr
    
To show the current version of the devkit, type:

    freakc --version

To create a new FreakC project quickly, you can type:

    freakc project_name --create
    
To show all options and usage, type:

    freakc --help
    
To show all options and usage (with a dumb ascii art), type:

    freakc
    
### Interactive shell
To open interactive shell, type:

    freakc --shell
    ::Or fcshell
    
You can type in whatever you want, it will be stored in "tar.fclang". You can type in any of these commands to execute tasks:

<li>StartFuckin[cli] - Runs all the codes written</li>
<li>StopFuckin[cli] - Delete tar.fclang and exit</li>
<li>WipeAss[cli] - Resets codes</li>
<li>Shit[cli] - Clear console</li>

<b>The compiler only works on Windows, and can only be compiled to Batch.</b>

## In what part does FreakC upgrade from Batch ?
Well, FreakC is just an esoteric programming language, so you shouldn't expect FreakC to be upgraded from Batch, but here are some of them:

<li>Real while, do-while loops</li>
<li>Additional variables like 'numpoop', 'numpuke', etc</li>
<li>Additional functions like 'OddOrEven[fnc]', 'CoolHackerMan[fnc]',...</li>
<li>Additional operators like "++" or "--"</li>
<li><b><i>mEMe</i></b></li>

## Convert FreakC to .EXE files
In "FreakC/Utilities/Scripts" there is a file called battoexe.bat which helps to convert .bat files to .exe files.

So to convert FreakC to .EXE files, you need to compile FreakC codes to Batch, and then convert the Batch file generated by simply dragging that Batch file onto battoexe.bat.

You can actually find plenty of other tools online that helps you to converts Batch files to EXE files.

## Frameworks
There are many frameworks in the utilities folder that you can use, I will definitely update the usage of them soon.

<b>Note: I don't own those frameworks.</b>

## 3.x Releases
3.x releases are the finest releases of FreakC, they removes all the unnecessary commands/functions, as well as adding many new useful features like:
<li>Useful variables</li>
<li>Useful functionalities like if statements, for loops, while loop, do-while loop, "++" and "--" operators and more</li>
<li>The compiler is much more well-built than all the previous releases</li>
