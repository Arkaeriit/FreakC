## What is FreakC ?
FreakC is an esoteric programming language that... has nothing to do with the C programming language. This programming language's syntax is dirty and funny, but it can actually make many decent programs.

## What is in the devkit ?
<li>A FreakC compiler</li>
<li>A FreakC terminal</li>
<li>Some optional utilities</li>

## Compiler's usage
In ./FreakC (or ./FreakC/Source) open cmd and type this command:

    freakc "file path(don't include .fclang)"
    
Example:
    
    freakc "Examples/HelloWorld"
 
 Then, run the Batch file that has been generated to run the compiled code.

<b>The compiler only works on Windows, and can only be compiled to Batch.</b>

## Convert FreakC to .EXE files
In "FreakC/Utilities/Scripts" there is a file called battoexe.bat which helps to convert .bat files to .exe files.

So to convert FreakC to .EXE files, you need to compile FreakC codes to Batch, and then convert the Batch file generated by simply dragging that Batch file onto battoexe.bat.

You can actually find plenty of other tools online that helps you to converts Batch files to EXE files.
    
## 2.x Releases
All the 2.x releases have the compiler rebuilt completely different from all the 0.x versions or 1.x versions. It is now fast and versatile, with much more power and ability to make some standard programs.
