## What is FreakC ?
FreakC is a transpiled multi-paradigm scripting language that... has nothing to do with the C programming language. It is very similar to Batch, it is written in Batch, and it is transpiled to Batch.

## Why FreakC ?
FreakC's just an experimental language at this stage and the performance is not that great, so it can be suitable for scripting and console-based applications. I usually fire up  FreakC to solve some small coding problems, or create a build/config file for my other projects. 

Furthermore, you can use the FreakC's source code to create your own programming language with ease, as FreakC is really short and there're not much complicated algorithms. Also, because it was built with Batch, you don't have to download any dependencies, any complicated build tools, you can just clone the repo and everything's already up and running!

Also, if you're familiar with Batch, you are probably having a hard day doing stuffs, but FreakC fixes some problems that Batch has, and:

* Many prebuilt standard libraries to make scripting easier.
* Compatibility with Batch (You can embed Batch codes in FreakC).
* Easy to use

FreakC's not created to be revolutionary or game-changing or anything like that, it's just created as a fun project by a high school student :) to make scripting easy, to upgrade Batch a little bit and to help people create their own language from FreakC's really simple source code.

### Language preview
Hello World:

    print[] Hello, World!

Function definition

    function[] SayHello
        print[] Hello
    endfunc[]
    :: Prints "Hello"
    SayHello[..]

## What comes with the devkit ?
* A compiler.
* An interactive shell.
* A full-blown cli.
* Some utilities.
* Some examples.

## What FreakC has that Batch doesn't ?
- It adds additional commands.
- It has many helpful libraries that Batch should have from the start.
- It comes with cool features like true functions, while loops, do-while loops, floats and even macros.

## Frameworks
Note that all Batch frameworks can integrate well with FreakC, so you can use them just like in Batch smoothly. There are some in the **Utilities** folder (on Github repo only, not included in the release) (which I don't own).

### Cool frameworks/libraries
* <a href="https://github.com/timlg07/Number.cmd">Number.cmd</a> - A library for handling floats
* <a href="https://github.com/mininmobile/discord.bat">Discord.bat - A library for creating discord bots</a>

### Game frameworks
There are many existing game engines for Batch/FreakC:
