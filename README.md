# FreakC
The FreakC Programming Language

## What is FreakC ?
FreakC is an esoteric programming language that... has nothing to do with the C programming language. This programming language can not do anything useful, it is created to be a joke for fun.

## Compiler's usage
In the source folder, run FreakC.bat. Then type in the name of the file (does not include .fclang) to compile the code. You will see a .bat file being generated because FreakC is compiled to Batch. Simply click on that Batch file to run the file. 
<b>The compiler only works on Windows, and can only be compiled to Batch. This compiler won't compile it to other languages or bytecodes.</b>
