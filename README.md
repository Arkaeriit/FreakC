## What is FreakC ?
FreakC is an esoteric programming language that... has nothing to do with the C programming language. This programming language can not do anything useful, it is created to be a joke for fun.

## Compiler's usage
In the source folder, run FreakC.bat. Then type in the name of the file (does not include .fclang) to compile the code. You will see a Batch file being generated because FreakC is compiled to Batch. Simply click on that Batch file to run the file. To run the file after it is compiled without having to run the Batch file, simply use FCI.

<li><b>The compiler only works on Windows, and can only be compiled to Batch. This compiler won't compile it to other languages or bytecodes. Also, the compiler is absolutely slow because it is not well-written at all, and Batch is slow anyway!</b></li>
<li><b>Please notice that this compiler only compiles codes in the range between line 1 and line 20, line 21 won't be compiled. That what makes this language even weirder.</b></li>

## Commands
<b>All necessary commands:</b>

<li>HelloWorld[str] - Print out "Hello, World!"</li>
<li>RandomNumMinimum[int] - Print out a random number from 0 to 99</li>
<li>RandomNumShort[int] - Print out a random number from 0 to 999</li>
<li>RandomNum[int] - Print out a random number from 0 to 99999</li>
<li>GrabMeADrink[str] - Print out "Grab me a drink"</li>
<li>Loop[fnc] - Loop the program endlessly</li>
<li>Sleep[fnc] - Timeout for a random time from 0 to 9 second(s)</li>
<li>Shutdown[fnc] - Shutdown system</li>
<li>Restart[fnc] - Restart system</li>
<li>EnterMatrix[fnc] - Printing out random numbers to make you feel like a hacker :)</li>
<li>EnterMatrixHacker[fnc] - Like the previuos but has green color :)</li>

<b>Comments</b>

Because FreakC compiles to Batch, you can comments in FreakC just like in Batch using:

    REM This is a comment in FreakC and Batch
    ::This is also a comment in FreakC and Batch
