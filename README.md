## What is FreakC ?
FreakC is a transpiled multi-paradigm scripting language that... has nothing to do with the C programming language. It is very similar to Batch, it is written in Batch, and it is transpiled to Batch.

## Why FreakC ?
If you're familiar with Batch, you are probably having a hard day doing stuffs, but FreakC fixes some problems that Batch has, and:

* Many prebuilt standard libraries to make scripting easier.
* Compatibility with Batch (You can embed Batch codes in FreakC).
* Easy to use

### Language preview
Hello World:

    print[] Hello, World!

Function definition

    function[] SayHello
        print[] Hello
    endfunc[]
    :: Prints "Hello"
    call[] SayHello

## What comes with the devkit ?
* A compiler.
* An interactive shell.
* A full-blown cli.
* Some utilities.
* Some examples.

## What FreakC has that Batch doesn't ?
- It adds additional commands.
- It has many helpful libraries that Batch should have from the start.
- It comes with cool features like true functions, while loops, do-while loops, floats and even macros.

## Frameworks
Note that all Batch frameworks can integrate well with FreakC, so you can use them just like in Batch smoothly. There are some in the **Utilities** folder (which I don't own).

### Cool frameworks/libraries
