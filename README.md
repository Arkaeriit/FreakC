## What is FreakC ?
FreakC is an esoteric programming language that... has nothing to do with the C programming language. This programming language can not do anything useful, it is created to be a joke for fun.

## Compiler's usage
In ./FreakC (or ./FreakC/Source) type this command:

    freakc "file path(don't include .fclang)"
    
Example:
    
    freakc "Examples/HelloWorld"
 
 Then, run the Batch file that has been generated to run the compiled code.

<li><b>The compiler only works on Windows, and can only be compiled to Batch.</b></li>

## Commands
<b>All necessary commands:</b>

<li>HelloWorld[str] - Print out "Hello, World!"</li>
<li>RandomNumMinimum[int] - Print out a random number from 0 to 99</li>
<li>RandomNumShort[int] - Print out a random number from 0 to 999</li>
<li>RandomNum[int] - Print out a random number from 0 to 99999</li>
<li>GrabMeADrink[str] - Print out "Grab me a drink"</li>
<li>Loop[fnc] - Loop the program endlessly</li>
<li>Sleep[fnc] - Timeout for a random time from 0 to 9 second(s)</li>
<li>ShutdownSystem[fnc] - Shutdown system</li>
<li>RestartSystem[fnc] - Restart system</li>
<li>EnterMatrix[fnc] - Printing out random numbers to make you feel like a hacker :)</li>
<li>EnterMatrixHacker[fnc] - Like the previuos but has green color :)</li>

<b>Comments</b>

Because FreakC compiles to Batch, you can comments in FreakC just like in Batch using:

    REM This is a comment in FreakC and Batch
    ::This is also a comment in FreakC and Batch
    
## 1.0 Release
