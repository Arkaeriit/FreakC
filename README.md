# FreakC
The FreakC Programming Language

## What is FreakC ?
FreakC is an esoteric programming language that... has nothing to do with the C programming language. This programming language can not do anything useful, it is created to be a joke for fun.

## Compiler's usage
In the source folder, run FreakC.bat. Then type in the name of the file (does not include .fclang) to compile the code. You will see a Batch file being generated because FreakC is compiled to Batch. Simply click on that Batch file to run the file.

## Commands
<li>HelloWorld[str] - Print out "Hello, World!"</li>
<li>RandomNumMinimum[int] - Print out a random number from 0 to 99</li>
<li>RandomNumShort[int]] - Print out a random number from 0 to 999</li>
<li>RandomNum[int] - Print out a random number from 0 to 99999</li>
<li>GrabMeADrink[str] - Print out "GrabMeADrink"</li>
<li>Loop[fnc] - Loop the program endlessly</li>
<li>Sleep[fnc] - Timeout for a random time from 0 to 9</li>
<li>EnterMatrix[fnc] - Printing out random numbers to make you feel like a hacker :)</li>
<li>EnterMatrixHacker[fnc] - Like the previuos but has green color :)</li>


<b>The compiler only works on Windows, and can only be compiled to Batch. This compiler won't compile it to other languages or bytecodes.</b>
